# General Knowledge Quiz App

This is a full-screen, single-page quiz application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The app tests users on general knowledge topics and includes features such as a 20-second timer per question, progress tracking (answered vs. remaining questions), and immediate feedback by revealing the correct answer if a wrong option is selected or time expires.

## Features

- **Modern Design:**  
  A full-screen, responsive layout with a light-green background and dark-green quiz container. Full-width answer buttons arranged vertically for easy clicking.

- **Timer:**  
  Each question is timed with a 20‑second countdown. If the user fails to select an answer within the time limit, the correct answer is automatically revealed.

- **Progress Tracking:**  
  A progress display shows how many questions have been answered and how many remain.

- **Immediate Feedback:**  
  When a wrong answer is selected (or time runs out), the correct answer is highlighted so the user can learn from their mistake.

- **Single‑Page Application:**  
  The quiz runs in one view without page reloads, providing a seamless user experience.
